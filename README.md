I'm [stormy](https://www.stormyark.de/), and in this documentation, I will describe how I have configured my homelab and the various tools I utilize. A homelab is a personal network environment where you can experiment with different technologies, improve your skills, and run various services. Setting up a homelab can be an incredibly rewarding experience, offering a hands-on approach to learning and development.

Whether you're a beginner looking to set up your first homelab or an experienced user seeking new ideas and tools, this documentation aims to provide valuable insights and practical instructions to help you build and optimize your own homelab using docker.
